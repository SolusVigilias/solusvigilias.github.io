### 🌀 Overview

**MirrorVerse v2** enters **Phase D**, extending the momentum-first and adaptive-field frameworks into a **multi-scale system** — where individual and collective dynamics co-evolve through entropy flow and structural covariance.

Each individual forms a **local adaptive field**, characterized by:
- Structural covariance **Σ(t)** — long-term behavioral correlation;
- Momentum entropy **Hₘₒₘ(t)** — instantaneous uncertainty and flow.

At higher scales (region, city, nation), these local fields interact and **aggregate into a federated covariance structure**, enabling cross-scale adaptability without central control.

---

### ⚙️ Architecture

**Phase D introduces:**
- A **multi-scale coordination loop**, connecting local LinUCB controllers with regional aggregation.  
- A **federated entropy update** mechanism — respecting individual autonomy and privacy through differential aggregation.  
- **Safety & fairness modules** — including opt-out, cooling control, and fairness checks.  

Each controller optimizes its **exploration temperature (αₜ)** in response to entropy flow, ensuring that **stability and exploration** remain in thermodynamic balance across levels of the system.

### 🔍 From Local to Global Adaptation

In this framework:
- Each user’s covariance matrix defines their **local adaptive field**, continuously evolving with experience and interaction.
- Aggregated regional covariance reflects **collective adaptability**, allowing communities to **reshape their structural entropy** together.
- This feedback forms a **living system**—a distributed network that learns not just *within*, but *across* scales.

### 🧭 Outlook

Phase D will explore:
1. **Federated LinUCB networks** with adaptive privacy guarantees.  
2. **Entropy aggregation pipelines** validating cross-scale stability.  
3. **Visual field maps** illustrating the evolution of effective dimensions over time.  

This phase builds directly on the thermodynamic controller of Phase C, moving from isolated adaptability to **shared adaptability** — a new kind of dynamic coherence between individuals and collectives.
